# Hi, I'm Valeriia 👋

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering. Alongside my studies, I'm actively developing projects and learning new technologies on my own.

I have hands-on experience with C# and .NET, and I'm now also working on projects using Java.

This GitHub contains a mix of small and larger learning projects.  
For key projects, I’ve recorded demo videos to show how they work.
