# Hi, I'm Valeriia 👋

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering. Alongside my studies, I'm actively developing projects and learning new technologies on my own.

I have hands-on experience with C# and .NET (WinForms, WPF, Telegram bots, mobile apps), and I'm now also working on projects using Java.

This GitHub contains a mix of small and larger learning projects.  
For key projects, I’ve recorded demo videos to show how they work.

## 🎥 Project Demos (Video)

### Projects include:
- 🌐 WPF desktop apps
- 📱 Android weather app (city → temperature)
- 🤖 Telegram bot with API integration

## 🧪 Web Projects (coming soon)
I'll be adding web-based projects here later — stay tuned.

## 🔧 Technologies
C#, .NET, WinForms, WPF, Java, REST APIs, Visual Studio, Git, Android
