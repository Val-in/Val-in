# Hi, I'm Valeriia 👋

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering, where I deepen my programming skills and explore new technologies through personal projects.

I have hands-on experience in Java, including backend logic, database integration, and API development, and I also have experience with C#/.NET projects.

This GitHub contains a mix of small and larger learning projects.
For key projects, I’ve recorded demo videos to show how they work.
